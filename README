This is my first jquery mobile project that implements a simple phonelist for a mobile device.

A phonelist.json is required in the root of the project. It should contain phone numbers using the following structure:

{
    "category": [
        {
            "shortName":    "short name of a user",
            "name":         "long name of a user",
            "firstNumber":  "number",
            "secondNumber": "number"
        },
...


 ],
    "another category": [
        {
            "shortName":    "short name of another user",
            "name":         "long name of another user",
            "firstNumber":  "number",
            "secondNumber": "number"
        },
...
    ]
}
