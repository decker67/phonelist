This is my first jquery mobile project that implements a simple phonelist for a mobile device.

A phonelist.json is required in the root of the project. It should contain phone numbers using the following structure:

{
    "employees": [
        {
            "user": "short name",
            "userName": "long name",
            "userNumber": "number",
            "userMobile": "mobile number"
        },
...


 ],
    "hiwis": [
        {
            "user": "short name",
            "userName": "long name",
            "userNumber": "number",
            "userMobile": "mobile number"
        },
...
    ]
}
